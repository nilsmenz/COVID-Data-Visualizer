# COVID-Data-Visualization
This was created as a final project for ISE 435 Intro to Python. It involves using Matplotlib, PySimpleGUi, Pandas, and Basemap to visualize coronavirus data.
In order to run the code PySimpleGUi, pandas and the Basemap extention to Matplotlib will need to be installed on your machine. I have added the basemap files in the folder as pip install does not work. they need to be copied to the C:\Users\nilsr\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\mpl_toolkits folder on your machine.
